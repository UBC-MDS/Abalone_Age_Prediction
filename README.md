# Abalone_Age_Prediction

## Introduction
In this project, we are going to estimate abalone's age from physical measurements. Abalone is a kind of shellfish that lives in cold water. It has great health benefits based on the fact of low fat and high protein. The nutritional value in different ages is different, as well as economic value. Therefore, telling the age of abalone is an important question for scientists, fish farmers, and customers. The traditional way to determine the age of abalone is from the number of rings. Counting the rings is a time-consuming task since it requires a tedious process involving cutting the shell, staining it, and counting the rings under the microscope. Thus, we consider using other easily obtained measures to predict the age. 

The dataset used in this project comes from an original study "The Population Biology of Abalone (_Haliotis_ species) in Tasmania. I. Blacklip Abalone (_H. rubra_) from the North Coast and Islands of Bass Strait", created by Warwick J Nash, Tracy L Sellers, Simon R Talbot, Andrew J Cawthorn and Wes B Ford (1994). It was sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and can be found [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/abalone/). Each row in the data set represents an abalone, including the physical measurements(Sex, Length, Diameter, Height, Whole weight, etc.) and the number of rings, which gives the age in years by adding 1.5. The missing values in the original study have been removed and the range of continuous values has been scaled. Please find the detailed information [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone?pagewanted=all).
