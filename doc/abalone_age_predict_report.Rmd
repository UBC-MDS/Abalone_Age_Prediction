# Summary

To predict abalone's age from physical measurements, we build a regression model using a popular type of regularized linear regression model Ridge. The model can use the physical measurements(Sex, Length, Diameter, Height, Whole weight, etc.) to predict the age of abalone in decimal number. Our final Ridge model can predict age in a good accuracy on an unseen test data set, with $R^2$ score of 0.55, and 13 mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). However, considering the potential economic losses to the stakeholders, we recommend further improvement before it is put into the industry.

# Methods

## Data
The dataset used in this project comes from an original study "The Population Biology of Abalone (_Haliotis_ species) in Tasmania. I. Blacklip Abalone (_H. rubra_) from the North Coast and Islands of Bass Strait", created by Warwick J Nash, Tracy L Sellers, Simon R Talbot, Andrew J Cawthorn and Wes B Ford (1994). It was sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and can be found [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/abalone/). Each row in the data set represents an abalone, including the physical measurements(Sex, Length, Diameter, Height, Whole weight, etc.) and the number of rings, which gives the age in years by adding 1.5. The missing values in the original study have been removed and the range of continuous values has been scaled. Please find the detailed information [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone?pagewanted=all).


## Analysis
The Ridge model was used to build a regression model to predict abalone age based on the physical measures, which involve 1 categorical feature ("age"), and 7 numerical features ("Length", "Diameter", "Height", "Whole weight", "Shucked weight", "Viscera weight", and "Shell weight"). All features are contained in the original data set. The predicting target "age" is converted from the "rings" in the original data set by adding 1.5. Before fitting the model, we exclude 1 outlier with extremely large height, and apply a standard scale transformation on numerical features. The model parameter $alpha$ was chosen using a randomized search on hyperparameters in 5-fold cross-validation with $R^2$ as the evaluation metric.


The Python programming languages [@Python] and the following Python packages were used to perform the analysis: docopt [@docoptpython], Pandas [@pandas], Seaborn [@seaborn], Scikit-learn [@sklearn], Numpy [@numpy], Pickle [@pickle], Matplotlib [@hunter2007matplotlib]. The R language programming languages [@R] and knitr [@knitr] were used to generate this report. The code used to perform the analysis and create this report can be found here: https://github.com/UBC-MDS/Abalone_Age_Prediction.

# Results & Discussion

To determine which features are useful to predict the target, we explore all columns in the train data set. From the correlation heat map below, we can see that the shell weight is the feature that is most correlated to the target age because the correlation value is largest among all features. All numerical features have a positive relationship between each other.

```{r plot corr heatmap, fig.width=10, fig.height=3,fig.cap="Figure 1. Correlation of All Abalone Numerical Column.",out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../results/eda/corr_plot.png")
```


To examine the correlation between the target Age and numerical features, we take a further step to plot the 2D histogram plot below. We can see that the target Age is positively correlated with all the numerical features. 

```{r plot scatter, fig.width=10, fig.height=3,fig.cap="Figure 2. Correlation of Abalone Age with Numerical Features.",out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../results/eda/all_vs_age_dist.png")
```

Then we explore the age distribution conditioning by different Sex. The number of instances of Infants, Males and Females are pretty close to each other. The mean, median, 25% Quartile, and 75% Quartile of Age for Infants are all lower than that for Males and Females. This categorical feature is a good indicator to the age.

```{r plot voilin, fig.width=10, fig.height=3,fig.cap="Figure 3. Correlation of Abalone Age with Sex.",out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../results/eda/sex_vs_age_violin.png")
```

In summary, after exploring the data, we can clearly see that all features have relationship with the target. Thus, we are going to use all features as the model input.
